Changes in version 0.4 ("Fitzebohnen"):
  - increase minimal version number for mpfrcx to 0.6.3 and for
    pari to 2.11.
  - add decomposition of the class field into a tower of prime degree
    extensions
  - add a fastECPP implementation, including a version for MPI

Changes in version 0.3.1 ("Wurstebrei"):
  - increase minimal version number for mpfrcx to 0.5 and for pari to 2.9.
  - many internal rewrites
  - bug fixes

Changes in version 0.3 ("Wurstebrei"):
  - Features
    - use the baby-step giant-step algorithm of Enge-Hart-Johansson 2018 to
      compute the eta series
    - use a 2-system for j and a 6-system for gamma2, which increases the
      chances of staying in the same order for the numerator of the Weber
      function
  - Miscellanea
    - switch to GPL3+ license

Changes in version 0.2.1 ("Blindhühnchen"):
  - Features
    - enable precision beyond 300000 bits
  - Dependencies
    - increase minimal version number for mpfr to 3.0.0, for mpc to 1.0.0
      and for pari to 2.7.0

Changes in version 0.2 ("Blindhühnchen"):
  - Features
    - new class invariants: multiple eta quotients with '-imultieta'
    - double eta quotients with both primes >100
    - new parameter choice for double eta quotients yielding smaller class
      polynomials
    - slightly lower height bounds for double eta quotients
  - Bug fixes
    - printing of field and curve cardinality even without parameter "-v"
    - Weber polynomials work again (activated by "-iweber")
    - class polynomials for D=-4 and D=-16 work (no curve is constructed)
  - Dependencies
    - factorisation of class polynomials is done by pari instead of ntl
     
Version 0.1 ("Apfelkraut"):
  - initial release
